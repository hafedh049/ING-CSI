### **1. Hats for Hackers (Ethical vs. Malicious Roles)**  
- **White Hat**: Ethical hackers who work legally to secure systems.  
- **Black Hat**: Malicious hackers exploiting systems for personal gain.  
- **Grey Hat**: Operate in a moral "grey area" (e.g., hacking without permission but disclosing vulnerabilities).  
- **Red Team**: Simulate attacks to test defenses.  
- **Blue Team**: Defend against attacks and monitor systems.  
- **Green Hat**: Newcomers learning hacking basics.  
- **Script Kiddie**: Unskilled hackers using pre-made tools.

### **2. Types of "Boxes" (Testing Environments)**  
- **Black Box Testing**: No prior knowledge of the system (simulates external attacks).  
- **White Box Testing**: Full knowledge of the system (internal audits).  
- **Grey Box Testing**: Partial knowledge (e.g., user-level access).  
- **Sandbox**: Isolated environment to safely analyze malware/test code.  
- **Pwnbox**: Pre-configured VM for penetration testing (e.g., HackTheBox).

### **3. Cyber Attack Cycle**  
Based on the **Cyber Kill Chain** (Lockheed Martin):  
1. **Reconnaissance**: Gathering target info (e.g., phishing emails, network scans).  
2. **Weaponization**: Creating exploit tools (e.g., malware payloads).  
3. **Delivery**: Transmitting the weapon (e.g., email attachments, malicious links).  
4. **Exploitation**: Triggering the vulnerability.  
5. **Installation**: Establishing persistence (e.g., backdoors).  
6. **Command & Control (C2)**: Remote control of compromised systems.  
7. **Actions on Objectives**: Data theft, ransomware deployment, etc.  

**Alternative Phases**:  
- Planning → Scanning → Gaining Access → Maintaining Access → Covering Tracks.

### **4. Types of Cyber Attacks**  
**Network-Based Attacks**:  
- DDoS/DoS (overload systems)  
- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)  
- DNS Spoofing/Poisoning  
- Packet Sniffing  

**Application/System Attacks**:  
- SQL Injection  
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- Zero-Day Exploits  
- Buffer Overflow  

**Social Engineering**:  
- Phishing/Spear Phishing  
- Baiting (e.g., infected USB drops)  
- Pretexting (fake identities to extract info)  

**Credential-Based**:  
- Brute Force/Password Spraying  
- Credential Stuffing  

**Advanced Attacks**:  
- APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats: long-term campaigns)  
- Supply Chain Attacks (compromise third-party vendors)  
- AI-Powered Attacks (e.g., deepfake phishing)  

---

### **5. Types of Malware**  
- **Virus**: Attaches to clean files and spreads.  
- **Worm**: Self-replicating malware spreading via networks.  
- **Trojan**: Disguised as legitimate software (e.g., Remote Access Trojan).  
- **Ransomware**: Encrypts data for ransom (e.g., WannaCry).  
- **Spyware**: Secretly monitors user activity (e.g., keyloggers).  
- **Adware**: Displays unwanted ads; often bundled with free software.  
- **Rootkit**: Gains admin-level control and hides itself.  
- **Botnet**: Network of infected devices controlled by attackers.  
- **Fileless Malware**: Resides in memory, leaving no files.  
- **Cryptojacking**: Uses victim’s resources to mine cryptocurrency.  
- **Logic Bomb**: Triggers after specific conditions (e.g., time-based).  
- **Wiper Malware**: Destroys data (e.g., NotPetya).

# 🔥 **Red Team vs. Blue Team in Cybersecurity** 🔥

In the world of **cyber warfare**, two elite forces are constantly at battle:

- 🟥 **Red Team** → The **offensive** hackers, simulating real-world attacks to exploit weaknesses.
- 🟦 **Blue Team** → The **defensive** warriors, shielding systems from breaches and countering threats.

When combined, they form a **Purple Team**, ensuring **continuous evolution** of security tactics.

## 🏴‍☠️ **The Bad Pyramid: Hacker Hierarchy**

Hackers come in different skill levels, forming a **"Bad Pyramid"** of cyber threats:

1️⃣ **🍼 Script Kiddies** – Rely on pre-made tools with zero understanding.  
2️⃣ **🎭 Hacktivists** – Attack for ideology, disrupting governments & corporations.  
3️⃣ **💰 Cybercriminals** – Seek profit through ransomware, data theft, and fraud.  
4️⃣ **🏴‍☠️ State-Sponsored Hackers** – Operate under government agencies for espionage & cyber warfare.  
5️⃣ **👁️ APT (Advanced Persistent Threats)** – The **elite** groups, launching stealthy, long-term cyber campaigns.

## ⚔️ **Red Team APT Attack Lifecycle**

APTs don’t just "hack"—they **infiltrate, persist, and conquer** using a structured attack lifecycle:

🕵️ **1. Reconnaissance** – Spying on the target, gathering intelligence.  
🦠 **2. Weaponization** – Crafting deadly exploits and malware.  
✉️ **3. Delivery** – Injecting the payload (phishing, malicious links, USB drops).  
🔓 **4. Exploitation** – Breaking into the system, bypassing defenses.  
🐍 **5. Installation** – Establishing hidden backdoors & persistence.  
🛰️ **6. Command & Control (C2)** – Maintaining remote access.  
💣 **7. Exfiltration & Impact** – Stealing data, deploying ransomware, causing destruction.

💀 _Once inside, APTs don’t just leave—they lurk, waiting to strike._

## 🔐 **CIA Triad & Security Foundations**

At the core of cybersecurity lies the **CIA Triad**:

🔵 **Confidentiality** – **Keep it secret!** Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.  
🟢 **Integrity** – **Keep it real!** Ensure data isn't altered or tampered with.  
🔴 **Availability** – **Keep it running!** Ensure systems remain operational.

But that’s not all—security involves **AAA Principles**:

✔️ **Identification** – Recognizing the user or system.  
✔️ **Authentication** – Verifying identity (passwords, biometrics, MFA).  
✔️ **Authorization** – Granting permissions based on identity.

Without these, your security is just an **illusion**. 🫣

## 🔄 **Hashing & Cryptography: The Art of Digital Secrets**

### **🔗 Hashing – The Digital Fingerprint**

🔹 **One-way transformation** of data into a fixed-length hash (SHA-256, MD5).  
🔹 Used for **password storage, integrity checks, digital signatures**.  
🔹 **Irreversible** – You can’t "decrypt" a hash!

### **🔑 Cryptography: The Science of Secrecy**

Two types of encryption secure your data:

🔵 **Symmetric Encryption (Fast but Risky)**

- Uses a **single key** for both encryption & decryption.
- **Examples:** AES, DES, 3DES.
- **Use case:** File encryption, VPN tunnels.

🔴 **Asymmetric Encryption (Slow but Secure)**

- Uses a **public-private key pair** for encryption & decryption.
- **Examples:** RSA, ECC, Diffie-Hellman.
- **Use case:** SSL/TLS (web security), digital signatures, secure messaging.

🎭 **Symmetric = A shared secret 🔑 | Asymmetric = A locked box with two keys 🔐**
