### **1. Hats for Hackers (Ethical vs. Malicious Roles)**  
- **White Hat**: Ethical hackers who work legally to secure systems.  
- **Black Hat**: Malicious hackers exploiting systems for personal gain.  
- **Grey Hat**: Operate in a moral "grey area" (e.g., hacking without permission but disclosing vulnerabilities).  
- **Red Team**: Simulate attacks to test defenses.  
- **Blue Team**: Defend against attacks and monitor systems.  
- **Green Hat**: Newcomers learning hacking basics.  
- **Script Kiddie**: Unskilled hackers using pre-made tools.

### **2. Types of "Boxes" (Testing Environments)**  
- **Black Box Testing**: No prior knowledge of the system (simulates external attacks).  
- **White Box Testing**: Full knowledge of the system (internal audits).  
- **Grey Box Testing**: Partial knowledge (e.g., user-level access).  
- **Sandbox**: Isolated environment to safely analyze malware/test code.  
- **Pwnbox**: Pre-configured VM for penetration testing (e.g., HackTheBox).

### **3. Cyber Attack Cycle**  
Based on the **Cyber Kill Chain** (Lockheed Martin):  
1. **Reconnaissance**: Gathering target info (e.g., phishing emails, network scans).  
2. **Weaponization**: Creating exploit tools (e.g., malware payloads).  
3. **Delivery**: Transmitting the weapon (e.g., email attachments, malicious links).  
4. **Exploitation**: Triggering the vulnerability.  
5. **Installation**: Establishing persistence (e.g., backdoors).  
6. **Command & Control (C2)**: Remote control of compromised systems.  
7. **Actions on Objectives**: Data theft, ransomware deployment, etc.  

**Alternative Phases**:  
- Planning → Scanning → Gaining Access → Maintaining Access → Covering Tracks.

### **4. Types of Cyber Attacks**  
**Network-Based Attacks**:  
- DDoS/DoS (overload systems)  
- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)  
- DNS Spoofing/Poisoning  
- Packet Sniffing  

**Application/System Attacks**:  
- SQL Injection  
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- Zero-Day Exploits  
- Buffer Overflow  

**Social Engineering**:  
- Phishing/Spear Phishing  
- Baiting (e.g., infected USB drops)  
- Pretexting (fake identities to extract info)  

**Credential-Based**:  
- Brute Force/Password Spraying  
- Credential Stuffing  

**Advanced Attacks**:  
- APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats: long-term campaigns)  
- Supply Chain Attacks (compromise third-party vendors)  
- AI-Powered Attacks (e.g., deepfake phishing)

### **5. Types of Malware**  
- **Virus**: Attaches to clean files and spreads.  
- **Worm**: Self-replicating malware spreading via networks.  
- **Trojan**: Disguised as legitimate software (e.g., Remote Access Trojan).  
- **Ransomware**: Encrypts data for ransom (e.g., WannaCry).  
- **Spyware**: Secretly monitors user activity (e.g., keyloggers).  
- **Adware**: Displays unwanted ads; often bundled with free software.  
- **Rootkit**: Gains admin-level control and hides itself.  
- **Botnet**: Network of infected devices controlled by attackers.  
- **Fileless Malware**: Resides in memory, leaving no files.  
- **Cryptojacking**: Uses victim’s resources to mine cryptocurrency.  
- **Logic Bomb**: Triggers after specific conditions (e.g., time-based).  
- **Wiper Malware**: Destroys data (e.g., NotPetya).
