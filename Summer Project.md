### SecOps Fusion Platform: Advanced Security Operations Center

This comprehensive cybersecurity project integrates multiple security technologies into a unified platform for enterprise security operations.

## Project Overview

The SecOps Fusion Platform is an end-to-end security operations center that combines defensive, offensive, and analytical capabilities. It integrates honeypots, IPS, deep learning, automation, and DevSecOps practices into a cohesive system that can detect, analyze, and respond to threats in real-time.
