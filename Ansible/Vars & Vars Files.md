Got it! You're referring to the different variable scopes in Ansible, particularly **play-level**, **global-level**, **host-level**, and **magic variables**. Here's the detailed explanation of each:

### 1. **Global Scope (`global_scope`)**

Global variables are accessible across all plays, tasks, and roles in an Ansible playbook. They can be defined in various places, including:

- **Inventory file** (either in `vars` or `group_vars`)
- **Playbook-wide `vars` section**
- **Command-line extra variables** (`-e`)
- **Configuration file (`ansible.cfg`)**

**Example:**

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  vars:
    global_var: "This is global"

- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - debug:
        msg: "{{ global_var }}"
```

In this example, `global_var` is available to all tasks in all plays, as it's defined at the playbook level.

### 2. **Play Scope (`play_scope`)**

Variables defined within a play are only accessible to that play and its tasks. These variables are defined in the `vars` section of a play.

**Example:**

```yaml
- hosts: all
  vars:
    play_var: "This is play specific"
  tasks:
    - debug:
        msg: "{{ play_var }}"
```

Here, `play_var` is available only within this play and its tasks.

### 3. **Host Scope (`host_scope`)**

Host variables are defined for specific hosts or groups of hosts. They can be set in the **inventory file**, **host_vars**, or **group_vars** directories. Host variables are only accessible to the specific host they are defined for.

- **In `host_vars/` directory**: Each host can have its own file defining specific variables.
- **In the inventory file**: Variables can be defined for individual hosts or for groups of hosts.

**Example (in `inventory.ini`):**

```ini
[web]
webserver1 ansible_host=192.168.1.1 my_var="Host-Specific Value"

[db]
dbserver1 ansible_host=192.168.1.2 db_var="Another Host-Specific Value"
```

**Example (in `host_vars/`):**

```yaml
# host_vars/webserver1.yml
my_var: "Host-Specific Value"
```

**Accessing in Playbook:**

```yaml
- hosts: web
  tasks:
    - debug:
        msg: "{{ my_var }}"  # Output will be "Host-Specific Value" for webserver1
```

Host variables like `my_var` in the `inventory.ini` are available only to `webserver1` and are not accessible to other hosts.

### 4. **Magic Variables**

Magic variables are pre-defined variables provided by Ansible that give information about the environment, system, or playbook execution. These variables are **built-in** and can be used across any play, task, or role.

Some common magic variables include:

- **`{{ inventory_hostname }}`**: The name of the current host as defined in the inventory.
- **`{{ ansible_facts }}`**: A dictionary of gathered system facts (e.g., OS, memory, etc.).
- **`{{ hostvars }}`**: A dictionary of all host variables, accessible by hostname.
- **`{{ playbook_dir }}`**: The directory containing the playbook.
- **`{{ ansible_playbook }}`**: The current playbook’s name.
- **`{{ ansible_user }}`**: The user Ansible uses to connect to the remote hosts.
- **`{{ ansible_hostname }}`**: The hostname of the machine.

**Example:**

```yaml
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - debug:
        msg: "Current host is {{ inventory_hostname }}"
    - debug:
        msg: "OS family is {{ ansible_facts['os_family'] }}"
```

In this example:

- `inventory_hostname` is a magic variable that provides the name of the current host being targeted by Ansible.
- `ansible_facts['os_family']` is a part of the gathered facts about the host.

### 5. **Precedence of Variables**

Ansible variables follow a **specific precedence** when determining which variable value to use. Here's the order of precedence from lowest to highest:

1. **Role defaults** (`defaults/main.yml`)
2. **Inventory variables** (defined in `inventory.ini` or `host_vars/`)
3. **Group variables** (defined in `group_vars/`)
4. **Playbook vars** (defined in the `vars` section of the playbook)
5. **Facts** (gathered facts, e.g., `ansible_facts`)
6. **Host-specific variables** (from `host_vars/`)
7. **Magic variables** (such as `inventory_hostname`)
8. **Command-line extra-vars** (`-e` or `--extra-vars`)

The higher the precedence, the more likely the value will override values from lower-precedence variables.

---

### Summary

- **Global Scope**: Variables defined at a global level (playbook, `ansible.cfg`, inventory, extra-vars, etc.) are available throughout the playbook.
- **Play Scope**: Variables defined in the `vars` section of a play are only available to that specific play.
- **Host Scope**: Variables defined for specific hosts (in `host_vars/`, `inventory`, or `group_vars/`) are only available to those hosts.
- **Magic Variables**: Pre-defined variables like `inventory_hostname`, `ansible_facts`, etc., are available everywhere.

### 1. **Using `[]` (Square Brackets)**:

- The square bracket notation is used to access keys in a dictionary dynamically, which means you can use a variable or a string expression as the key.
- It is the standard way to access dictionary values in Python or Ansible.

**Example**:

```yaml
- debug:
    var: ansible_facts['ansible_hostname']
```

Here, you are accessing the `ansible_hostname` key from the `ansible_facts` dictionary.

### 2. **Using `.` (Dot Notation)**:

- The dot notation is a more concise way of accessing keys, but it is used when the key is a valid identifier (like a string that contains no spaces or special characters, and doesn't start with a number).
- It is more common in certain programming languages (like Python for object properties or in some YAML configurations).
- In Ansible, dot notation is commonly used when accessing facts that are directly part of the structure without requiring variable names.

**Example**:

```yaml
- debug:
    var: ansible_facts.ansible_hostname
```

Here, `ansible_facts.ansible_hostname` will access the `ansible_hostname` key from the `ansible_facts` dictionary.

### Key Differences:

- **`[]` (Square Brackets)**: Can be used for all cases, especially when the key is dynamic, has spaces, or contains special characters.
- **`.` (Dot Notation)**: Simpler, cleaner syntax for fixed, valid key names (no spaces, no special characters, etc.).

**Example where you can’t use dot notation**:

```yaml
- debug:
    var: ansible_facts['ansible_default_ipv4']['address']  # Using square brackets
```

You can't use dot notation here (`ansible_facts.ansible_default_ipv4.address` would not work because `ansible_default_ipv4` is a dictionary itself).

### Summary:

- Use `[]` when the key is dynamic or not a valid identifier (e.g., containing spaces or special characters).
- Use `.` when the key is a simple, valid identifier and is a direct attribute of the object (dictionary in this case).
