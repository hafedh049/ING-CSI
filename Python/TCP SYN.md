This Python script uses Scapy to send a TCP SYN packet to a specified target (`www.google.com` in this case) and checks for a response to determine if the target port (port 80, the HTTP port) is open. It uses TCP flags to interpret the response. Here’s an in-depth explanation of the code:

### 1. Importing Scapy
```python
from scapy.all import *
```
This imports all of Scapy's functionalities for handling network packets.

### 2. Building the Packet
```python
mon_paquet = IP(dst='www.google.com') / TCP(sport=12345, dport=80, flags='S')
```
Here’s a breakdown of the packet creation:
   - **IP Layer**: `IP(dst='www.google.com')` sets the destination IP to Google’s IP (resolved by Scapy).
   - **TCP Layer**: `TCP(sport=12345, dport=80, flags='S')` creates a TCP segment with:
      - **Source Port (`sport`)**: Randomly set to `12345` as the source port for this example.
      - **Destination Port (`dport`)**: Set to `80`, which is the HTTP port.
      - **Flags (`flags='S'`)**: The flag `'S'` sets the SYN flag, signaling the beginning of a connection request.

This packet (`mon_paquet`) is a TCP SYN packet, which is the first step in the TCP three-way handshake. It’s sent to check if the port is open.

### 3. Sending the Packet and Receiving the Response
```python
rep, non_rep = sr(mon_paquet, verbose=1)
```
   - `sr()` sends the packet `mon_paquet` and waits for a response.
   - `rep` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the sent packet and the corresponding received packet.
   - `non_rep` is a list of packets that didn’t receive any response.

### 4. Analyzing the Response
```python
for emis, recu in rep:
        print("Flag réponse -->: ", recu[1].flags)

        if recu[1].flags == 18:
              print('port ouvert : ', recu[1].sport)
        else:
              print('port fermé : ', recu[1].sport)
              print("\n")
```
In this block:
   - **Looping Over Responses**: The `for emis, recu in rep` loop goes through each sent and received packet pair.
   - **Checking Flags**:
      - The line `recu[1].flags` prints the flags in the response packet, `recu`.
      - **Port Open Check**: `if recu[1].flags == 18` checks if the flags are set to `18` (or `0x12` in hexadecimal), which corresponds to the **SYN-ACK** response.
         - `18` means the flags `SYN (0x02)` and `ACK (0x10)` are both set, indicating that the target responded positively to the SYN request, so the port is open.
         - If this condition is met, it prints `'port ouvert'` with the source port.
      - **Port Closed Check**: If the flags are anything other than `18`, it’s likely that the port is closed or filtered, and it prints `'port fermé'`.

### Summary
This script essentially performs a **TCP SYN scan**:
   - **SYN Packet** (`flags='S'`) is sent to check if a port is open.
   - **Response Interpretation**: If a **SYN-ACK (flags=18)** is received, the port is open. If another response or no response is received, the port is considered closed or filtered. This allows the user to determine which ports on a target host are open without fully establishing a TCP connection.

In TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), several flags are used to control the state of a connection. Each flag can be represented by a bit in the TCP header, and they can be combined in various ways. Below is a list of the commonly used TCP flags along with their corresponding hexadecimal and decimal values:

| Flag | Hex Value | Decimal Value | Description |
|------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| URG  | 0x20     | 32            | Urgent: Indicates that the Urgent pointer field is significant. |
| ACK  | 0x10     | 16            | Acknowledgment: Indicates that the Acknowledgment field is significant. |
| PSH  | 0x08     | 8             | Push: Requests the receiving TCP to pass the data to the application immediately. |
| RST  | 0x04     | 4             | Reset: Requests a reset of the connection. |
| SYN  | 0x02     | 2             | Synchronize: Used to initiate a connection (part of the three-way handshake). |
| FIN  | 0x01     | 1             | Finish: Indicates that the sender has finished sending data and wants to close the connection. |

### Combination of Flags
TCP flags can be combined using the bitwise OR operation. For example:
- **SYN-ACK** (used to acknowledge a SYN request): `SYN (0x02) | ACK (0x10)` = `0x12` (decimal 18).
- **FIN-ACK**: `FIN (0x01) | ACK (0x10)` = `0x11` (decimal 17).

### Summary
- **Urgent (URG)**: 0x20 (32)
- **Acknowledgment (ACK)**: 0x10 (16)
- **Push (PSH)**: 0x08 (8)
- **Reset (RST)**: 0x04 (4)
- **Synchronize (SYN)**: 0x02 (2)
- **Finish (FIN)**: 0x01 (1)

These flags play a crucial role in managing the lifecycle of TCP connections and ensuring proper communication between devices over the network.
