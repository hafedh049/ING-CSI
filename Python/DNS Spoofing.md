DNS spoofing, also known as DNS cache poisoning, is a type of cyberattack in which an attacker corrupts the Domain Name System (DNS) cache to redirect traffic from legitimate websites to malicious sites. The DNS system is responsible for translating domain names (like `www.example.com`) into IP addresses (like `192.0.2.1`). In a DNS spoofing attack, attackers manipulate this translation process, usually by injecting false DNS responses into the cache of a DNS server. This results in users being redirected to unauthorized sites without their knowledge.

Here's how DNS spoofing typically works:

1. **Attack Setup**: The attacker injects incorrect DNS information into a DNS serverâ€™s cache.
2. **Redirecting Traffic**: When users try to access a legitimate website, the compromised DNS server returns the false IP address.
3. **Malicious Intent**: Users are redirected to a malicious site controlled by the attacker, which may mimic the legitimate site to trick users into entering sensitive information, or it could host malware to infect the user's device.

**Consequences of DNS Spoofing**:
- **Phishing Attacks**: Users are tricked into providing sensitive information, like login credentials, on fake websites.
- **Malware Distribution**: Redirected sites can deliver malware or ransomware to users' devices.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: Attackers can intercept and manipulate communications between users and websites.

**Prevention**:
- **DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions)**: Adds a layer of security to DNS by authenticating responses to ensure they come from a verified source.
- **Regular Cache Flushing**: Prevents attackers from maintaining control over DNS cache entries.
- **Up-to-date Security Practices**: Antivirus, firewalls, and regular software updates help defend against DNS spoofing.

This code snippet uses Python and Scapy to perform network sniffing, specifically targeting DNS (Domain Name System) traffic on `eth0` (the first Ethernet interface).

### Code Explanation

1. **Network Sniffing on Port 53 (DNS)**:
   ```python
   p=sniff(count=1, filter="udp port 53", prn=procPacket)
   ```
   - **`sniff` function**: Captures network packets based on specified parameters.
     - **`count=1`**: Captures only one packet.
     - **`filter="udp port 53"`**: Filters for packets using UDP on port 53, which is typically DNS traffic.
     - **`prn=procPacket`**: Calls the `procPacket` function each time a packet is captured, allowing you to analyze it.

2. **Packet Processing in `procPacket`**:
   ```python
   def procPacket(p):
       eth_layer = p.getlayer(Ether)
       src_mac, dst_mac = (eth_layer.src, eth_layer.dst)
       ip_layer = p.getlayer(IP)
       src_ip, dst_ip = (ip_layer.src, ip_layer.dst)
       udp_layer = p.getlayer(UDP)
   ```
   - **`eth_layer = p.getlayer(Ether)`**: Gets the Ethernet layer, containing source and destination MAC addresses.
   - **MAC Addresses**:
     - **`src_mac, dst_mac = (eth_layer.src, eth_layer.dst)`**: Extracts the source and destination MAC addresses.
   - **IP Addresses**:
     - **`ip_layer = p.getlayer(IP)`**: Extracts the IP layer to access IP addresses.
     - **`src_ip, dst_ip = (ip_layer.src, ip_layer.dst)`**: Extracts source and destination IP addresses.
   - **UDP Layer**:
     - **`udp_layer = p.getlayer(UDP)`**: Retrieves the UDP layer to access port information.

3. **Extracting Port Information**:
   ```python
   src_port, dst_port = (udp_layer.sport, udp_layer.dport)
   
   if src_port == 53 or dst_port == 53:
            print("DNS packet detected (port 53)!")
   ```
   - **Source and Destination Ports**:
     - **`src_port`**: The port from which the packet was sent.
     - **`dst_port`**: The port to which the packet is being sent.
     - Since the filter targets DNS (UDP port 53), `dst_port` will often be 53 if the packet is a DNS query.

### Purpose of This Code
This code captures DNS packets and retrieves key information, including:
- **MAC addresses** (`src_mac`, `dst_mac`)
- **IP addresses** (`src_ip`, `dst_ip`)
- **Ports** (`src_port`, `dst_port`)
