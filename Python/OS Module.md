The `os` module allows Python programs to interact with the user's operating system. It is part of Python 3's standard library, meaning it is always available. However, the availability of the `os` module methods and their behavior can vary depending on the host system. This module contains 195 methods:

- 105 methods are available only on UNIX systems, including most Linux distributions.
- 71 methods are available on UNIX systems and Microsoft Windows.
- 14 methods are available only on certain versions of Linux.
- 5 methods are available only on Microsoft Windows.

Environment variables available for the user's operating system and their values can be accessed with `os.environ`, which returns a dictionary. You can print these variables using:

```python
for key, value in os.environ.items():
    print(key, ":", value)
```

Before calling a method from the `os` module, it is important to ensure that it is supported on the current system, to avoid exceptions. Wrapping such calls in a `try...except...finally` block is recommended.

Depending on the program's requirements, other methods or modules might be better suited for certain tasks. For example:

- The `open()` method allows reading and writing records in a file.
- The `os.path` module is recommended for managing paths and file locations.
- The `fileinput` module reads all lines from all files specified in the command line.
- The `tempfile` module is optimized for creating and managing temporary files and directories.
- The `shutil` module is used for manipulating files and directories at a higher level.
- The `platform` module provides detailed information about the user's operating system.
- The `sys` module returns or modifies environment variables.
- The `tkinter.filedialog` module provides tools for quick file and directory management.

Sure, I'll provide examples for each of the functions highlighted from the `os` module.

### Examples of `os` Module Functions

1. **`_exit()`**: Forces the process to stop.

   ```python
   import os

   print("Before exit")
   os._exit(0)
   print("This will not be printed")
   ```
   
   In this example, the program exits before the second print statement.

2. **`abort()`**: Sends a `SIGABRT` signal to the process.

   ```python
   import os

   try:
       os.abort()
   except:
       print("Aborted!")
   ```

   This example terminates the process by raising `SIGABRT`.

3. **`access()`**: Tests if the user has one or more access rights to a file.

   ```python
   import os

   path = "example.txt"
   if os.access(path, os.R_OK):
       print(f"{path} is readable.")
   else:
       print(f"{path} is not readable.")
   ```

   This checks if the file "example.txt" is readable.

4. **`add_dll_directory()`**: Adds a directory to search for DLLs (only for Windows).

   ```python
   import os

   if os.name == "nt":
       os.add_dll_directory("C:\\example\\dll_folder")
   ```

   This example adds a directory to the DLL search path on Windows.

5. **`chdir()`**: Changes the working directory.

   ```python
   import os

   print("Current Directory:", os.getcwd())
   os.chdir("/tmp")
   print("Changed Directory:", os.getcwd())
   ```

   The current working directory changes to "/tmp".

6. **`chflags()`**: Modifies or sets options for a file.

   ```python
   import os
   import stat

   path = "example.txt"
   os.chflags(path, stat.UF_APPEND)
   print(f"Flags of {path} changed to append-only.")
   ```

   This sets the append-only flag for "example.txt" (UNIX-only).

7. **`chmod()`**: Changes the access rights of a file.

   ```python
   import os
   import stat

   os.chmod("example.txt", stat.S_IRWXU)
   print("Permissions of 'example.txt' changed to read, write, execute by the owner.")
   ```

   This gives read, write, and execute permissions to the owner of "example.txt".

8. **`chown()`**: Changes the user and group ownership of a file.

   ```python
   import os

   os.chown("example.txt", uid=1000, gid=1000)
   print("Changed ownership of 'example.txt'.")
   ```

   This changes the user and group ownership of "example.txt" to user ID 1000 and group ID 1000 (UNIX-only).

9. **`chroot()`**: Changes the root directory of the current process.

   ```python
   import os

   try:
       os.chroot("/new_root")
       print("Changed root directory.")
   except PermissionError:
       print("Operation not permitted.")
   ```

   This example attempts to change the root directory (requires root privileges).

10. **`closerange()`**: Closes file descriptors within a given range.

    ```python
    import os

    fd1 = os.open("example.txt", os.O_CREAT | os.O_WRONLY)
    fd2 = os.open("example2.txt", os.O_CREAT | os.O_WRONLY)
    
    os.closerange(fd1, fd2 + 1)
    print("File descriptors closed.")
    ```

    This closes file descriptors in the given range.

11. **`confstr()`**: Returns the textual form of a specified configuration value.

    ```python
    import os

    value = os.confstr("CS_PATH")
    print("CS_PATH:", value)
    ```

    This returns the value of the configuration variable `CS_PATH`.

12. **`copy_file_range()`**: Copies a number of bytes from one file to another.

    ```python
    import os

    with open("source.txt", "r") as src, open("destination.txt", "w") as dst:
        os.copy_file_range(src.fileno(), dst.fileno(), 0, 50)
    print("50 bytes copied from source.txt to destination.txt.")
    ```

    This copies 50 bytes from `source.txt` to `destination.txt`.

13. **`cpu_count()`**: Returns the number of available CPU cores.

    ```python
    import os

    cores = os.cpu_count()
    print("Number of CPU cores:", cores)
    ```

    This prints the number of available CPU cores.

14. **`ctermid()`**: Returns the identifier of the POSIX terminal controlling the process.

    ```python
    import os

    if hasattr(os, "ctermid"):
        print("Control terminal ID:", os.ctermid())
    ```

    This returns the terminal identifier if it is available.

15. **`device_encoding()`**: Returns the description of the encoding system of a device.

    ```python
    import os

    with open("example.txt", "w") as f:
        print("Encoding:", os.device_encoding(f.fileno()))
    ```

    This prints the encoding of the file descriptor.
