Let's go through this code step-by-step to understand how it performs an ICMP ping sweep on a range of IP addresses. This code uses the `scapy` library in Python, which allows for crafting and sending network packets.

### Code Explanation

```python
from scapy.all import *
```

- This line imports all functions and classes from the `scapy` library, which includes tools for creating, sending, and analyzing network packets.

---

```python
_range = '192.168.43.'
```

- This variable `_range` is a string that contains the first three octets of the IP range that we want to scan. In this case, it’s `192.168.43.`.
- The script will use this string as a base to build a complete IP address by adding the last octet (the part after the last dot).

---

```python
for ip in range(1,9): 
    adr = _range + str(ip)
    print(adr)
```

- This loop iterates over the last octet of the IP address, ranging from `1` to `8` (inclusive).
- In each iteration:
  - `ip` takes on a value from `1` to `8`.
  - `adr` is constructed by concatenating `_range` with `ip`, creating an IP address in the form of `192.168.43.x`, where `x` is the value of `ip` in the current loop iteration.
  - `print(adr)` prints the IP address being constructed, so you can see which IPs are being pinged.

**Example Output of `adr` in Each Loop:**
```
192.168.43.1
192.168.43.2
...
192.168.43.8
```

---

```python
    rep, non_rep = sr(IP(dst=adr) / ICMP(), timeout=2)
```

- This line sends an **ICMP packet** to the IP address `adr`.
  - `IP(dst=adr)`: Creates an IP packet with `adr` as the destination IP address.
  - `/ ICMP()`: Adds an ICMP layer to the packet, specifically an **ICMP echo request** (the type of packet sent in a typical "ping").
  - `sr`: The `sr` function in `scapy` stands for **"send and receive"**, meaning it sends a packet and waits for replies.
  - `timeout=2`: Sets a 2-second timeout for receiving responses. If no response is received within 2 seconds, it considers the packet unanswered.

- `sr` returns two lists:
  - `rep`: A list of **answered packets** (packets that received a response).
  - `non_rep`: A list of **unanswered packets** (packets that didn’t receive a response within the timeout).

- `print(rep)` prints the `rep` list, showing all replies received for this particular IP address. If a device responds, `rep` will contain that response.

---

```python
    for elem in rep:
        if elem[1].type == 0:
            print(elem[1].src + ' a renvoye un echo-reply')
```

- This part processes each reply in the `rep` list to check if it’s an **ICMP echo-reply**.
  - `for elem in rep`: Iterates over each item in `rep`.
    - Each `elem` in `rep` is a **tuple of two packets**:
      - `elem[0]`: The packet that was sent (the original ICMP request).
      - `elem[1]`: The packet that was received in response.

- `if elem[1].type == 0`: This checks if the type of the received packet (`elem[1]`) is `0`, which corresponds to **ICMP echo-reply** (indicating a response to a ping request).
  - Only echo-reply packets (`type == 0`) indicate that a device responded to the ping.

- `print(elem[1].src + ' a renvoye un echo-reply')`: 
  - This prints the IP address of the device that replied.
  - `elem[1].src` retrieves the **source IP** from the reply packet, which is the IP address of the responding device.
  - The message `' a renvoye un echo-reply'` (French for "has returned an echo-reply") is appended to indicate that this IP responded to the ping request.

**Example Output:**
```
192.168.43.1 a renvoye un echo-reply
```
This indicates that the device with IP `192.168.43.1` responded to the ICMP ping request.

---

### Summary of the Code Workflow

1. **Loop through IP addresses**: Iterates through IPs from `192.168.43.1` to `192.168.43.8`.
2. **Send an ICMP request to each IP**: Uses `sr` to send an ICMP echo request to each IP.
3. **Receive and filter responses**:
   - If a response is received (an ICMP echo-reply), it prints the IP of the responding device.
4. **Display Results**: For each IP address that replies, it confirms that the device is reachable by printing its IP.

This script essentially identifies which IPs in a small subnet are reachable, functioning like a **basic network scanner**.
