### Overview of `sys_brk()`

The `sys_brk()` system call is used for memory allocation in a process's address space. It allows you to set the highest available address in the data section of the memory directly behind the application image. This function is crucial for dynamic memory management as it helps allocate memory without requiring future movements of allocated blocks.

### Key Features of `sys_brk()`

- **Parameter**: The system call takes one parameter, which is the highest memory address you want to set. This value is passed through the `EBX` register.
- **Return Value**: On success, it returns the new highest memory address; on failure, it returns -1 or the negative error code.
- **Usage**: This system call is particularly useful when you want to manage memory dynamically without using higher-level abstractions provided by standard libraries.

### Example Program

The following program demonstrates how to allocate 16 KB of memory using the `sys_brk()` system call in assembly language.

```c
section .text
   global _start         ; Must be declared for using gcc
	
_start:	                 ; Tell linker entry point

   ; Set the current break point to the start of the heap
   mov eax, 45           ; sys_brk
   xor ebx, ebx          ; Set EBX to 0 to get the current break
   int 80h               ; Call kernel

   ; Calculate new break point for 16KB allocation
   add eax, 16384        ; Allocate 16 KB (16384 bytes)
   mov ebx, eax          ; Set EBX to the new break point
   mov eax, 45           ; sys_brk
   int 80h               ; Call kernel
	
   ; Check for errors
   cmp eax, 0            ; Compare return value with 0
   jl exit               ; Exit if error (less than 0)

   ; Initialize allocated memory to zero
   mov edi, eax          ; EDI = highest available address
   sub edi, 4            ; Point to the last DWORD
   mov ecx, 4096         ; Number of DWORDs to allocate (16 KB / 4 bytes)
   xor eax, eax          ; Clear EAX for setting values
   std                   ; Set direction flag to backward
   rep stosd             ; Repeat storing EAX in allocated area
   cld                   ; Clear direction flag for normal state
	
   ; Print success message
   mov eax, 4            ; sys_write
   mov ebx, 1            ; File descriptor: stdout
   mov ecx, msg          ; Message to print
   mov edx, len          ; Length of the message
   int 80h               ; Call kernel

exit:
   ; Exit the program
   mov eax, 1            ; sys_exit
   xor ebx, ebx          ; Return code 0
   int 80h               ; Call kernel
	
section .data
msg db "Allocated 16 kb of memory!", 10
len equ $ - msg         ; Calculate length of the message
```

### Explanation of the Program

1. **Setting the Initial Break Point**:
   - The program first calls `sys_brk()` to retrieve the current break point by setting `EBX` to 0.

2. **Calculating New Break Point**:
   - It then adds `16384` (16 KB) to the current break point and sets this value in `EBX`, preparing to allocate the memory.

3. **Calling `sys_brk()` Again**:
   - The program calls `sys_brk()` again to set the new break point.

4. **Error Checking**:
   - After calling `sys_brk()`, it checks if the return value is negative, indicating an error. If so, it jumps to the `exit` label.

5. **Initializing Allocated Memory**:
   - If the allocation is successful, it initializes the newly allocated memory to zero. It sets the `EDI` register to point to the end of the allocated block and uses the `stosd` instruction to store zeros in each DWORD of the allocated memory.

6. **Printing a Success Message**:
   - Finally, the program uses `sys_write` to print a message indicating that 16 KB of memory has been allocated successfully.

7. **Exiting the Program**:
   - The program exits cleanly using `sys_exit`.

### Output

When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following output:

```c
Allocated 16 kb of memory!
```

### Conclusion

This example illustrates how to use the `sys_brk()` system call for dynamic memory allocation in assembly language. The program demonstrates how to retrieve the current memory break, allocate additional memory, check for errors, and initialize the allocated memory.
