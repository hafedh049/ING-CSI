### **Electronic Codebook (ECB) Mode**

The **Electronic Codebook (ECB)** mode is the simplest and most straightforward mode of operation for block ciphers. It works by encrypting each block of plaintext independently using the same encryption key.

### **How ECB Works**

1. **Plaintext Splitting**:
    
    - The plaintext is divided into fixed-size blocks based on the block size of the cipher (e.g., 128 bits for AES).
    - If the plaintext is not a multiple of the block size, padding is added.
2. **Encryption**:
    
    - Each block of plaintext is encrypted separately using the same key.
    - For each block $P_i$ of plaintext: $C_i = E_K(P_i)$ where $E_K$ is the encryption function with the key $K$, and $C_i$ is the ciphertext block.
3. **Decryption**:
    
    - Each ciphertext block is decrypted independently to recover the plaintext: $P_i=D_K(C_i)$ where $D_K$ is the decryption function with the key $K$ .

### **Advantages of ECB**

1. **Simplicity**:
    - Easy to implement and understand because each block is processed independently.
2. **Parallel Processing**:
    - Since blocks are independent, encryption and decryption can be parallelized for faster processing.

### **Disadvantages of ECB**

1. **Lack of Security**:
    
    - Identical plaintext blocks produce identical ciphertext blocks.
    - This reveals patterns in the plaintext, making it susceptible to statistical analysis and known-plaintext attacks.
    - For example, if the plaintext contains repeated data (like images or structured data), the ciphertext will also show repeating patterns.
2. **No Confidentiality for Identical Data**:
    
    - If the same plaintext block is encrypted multiple times, the resulting ciphertext will always be the same. This exposes information about the plaintext structure.

### **When to Use ECB**

- **Not recommended for encrypting sensitive or structured data** due to its vulnerability to pattern recognition.
- Can be used in scenarios where **data integrity is more critical than confidentiality**, or where blocks are already randomized or do not repeat.

### **Illustrative Example**

Consider a 128-bit block cipher encrypting the plaintext:

**Plaintext**: `HELLOHELLOHELLO`  
**Blocks**: `[HELLO][HELLO][HELLO]`

If ECB is used:

- The first block is encrypted to produce $C_1$.
- The same plaintext block appears again and is encrypted to the same $C_1$, exposing the pattern.

This makes ECB **unsafe for encrypting structured or predictable data**, as an attacker could infer information about the plaintext without decrypting it.

### **Visual Representation**

If ECB is used to encrypt an image, the structure of the original image is preserved in the encrypted output, exposing significant details about the plaintext. This is one of the reasons why ECB is rarely used in practice.

**Conclusion**: ECB should be avoided in most real-world applications where confidentiality and security are important. Instead, modes like CBC, CTR, or GCM are better choices.
