### Key:
- **TCP**: Transmission Control Protocol (connection-oriented).
- **UDP**: User Datagram Protocol (connectionless, faster but less reliable than TCP).
- **Well-known ports**: 0-1023 are assigned by IANA for core services.
- **Registered ports**: 1024-49151 are used for applications by vendors and developers.
- **Dynamic/private ports**: 49152-65535 are typically used for temporary or private communications (like client-side connections).

This table provides a list of the most commonly used protocols and their services with corresponding ports.

### **Key ICMP Types and Use Cases**:
- **Type 0 (Echo Reply)**: Sent in response to an Echo Request (Type 8). Used for Ping.
- **Type 3 (Destination Unreachable)**: Used when a packet cannot reach its destination. Subtypes give more details on the cause.
- **Type 5 (Redirect)**: Used by routers to inform hosts of a better route for a particular destination.
- **Type 8 (Echo Request)**: Sent to a host to request an ICMP Echo Reply (Type 0). Used by the Ping utility.
- **Type 11 (Time Exceeded)**: Used in **traceroute** to show where packets are being dropped when TTL (Time to Live) reaches 0.

### **Deprecated ICMP Messages**:
Some ICMP messages like **Source Quench (Type 4)** or **Information Request (Type 15)** are now deprecated due to their inefficiency or security vulnerabilities.

These ICMP types are critical for troubleshooting and diagnostic tools like **ping** and **traceroute**, helping to ensure network connectivity and performance.
