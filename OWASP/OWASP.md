# 2. HTTPX (HTTP Exploitation tool & HTTP basics)

You said **all versions** and **request/response details**, so imma break it down real smooth.

### HTTP Versions:

- **HTTP/0.9:** The first one. Super basic, no headers, just raw HTML response.
    
- **HTTP/1.0:** Introduced headers, status codes, and request methods.
    
- **HTTP/1.1:** Added persistent connections, chunked transfer encoding, and more headers. Still the most used.
    
- **HTTP/2:** Binary framing, multiplexing, header compression ‚Äî faster and more efficient.
    
- **HTTP/3:** Uses QUIC (UDP-based), super low latency and better performance.
    

### HTTP Request Components:

- **Request line:**
    
    - Method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
        
    - URL/Path
        
    - HTTP Version
        
- **Headers:** Key-value pairs giving info like user-agent, content-type, cookies, etc.
    
- **Body:** Data sent with POST/PUT requests (like form data, JSON).
    

### HTTP Response Components:

- **Status Line:**
    
    - HTTP Version
        
    - Status Code (like 200, 404)
        
    - Reason Phrase ("OK", "Not Found")
        
- **Headers:** Meta info about the response (content-type, length, caching).
    
- **Body:** Actual response content (HTML, JSON, images, etc.)

- **Risk:**  
    Data is sent over unencrypted channels (HTTP instead of HTTPS), exposing credentials, session tokens, personal data to eavesdroppers.
    
- **Proof:**  
    Google dorks like `site:example.com -inurl:https` or manually inspecting traffic with tools like Wireshark.
    
- **Remediation:**
    
    - Enforce HTTPS with valid SSL/TLS certificates.
        
    - Use HSTS headers to force HTTPS.
        
    - Avoid deprecated crypto algorithms.
        
- **Side:** Client & Server (client must check TLS; server must enforce)
    

---

# 4. **SQL Injection (SQLi)**

- **Risk:**  
    Injected SQL code can read, modify, or delete database info, dump credentials, or escalate privileges.
    
- **Proof:**
    
    - Using dorks to find vulnerable inputs like `inurl:login.php?id=1'`
        
    - Manual tests with `' OR '1'='1` or `' UNION SELECT...`.
        
- **Types:**
    
    - **Error-based**: Extracts data via error messages.
        
    - **Union-based**: Combines results from multiple queries.
        
    - **Blind (Boolean, Time-based)**: No direct output; infer by true/false or time delays.
        
    - **Out-of-band**: Data retrieved through alternative channels.
        
- **Remediation:**
    
    - Use parameterized queries (prepared statements).
        
    - Validate and sanitize inputs.
        
    - Limit database permissions.
        
    - Employ Web Application Firewalls (WAF).
        
- **Side:** Server-side
    

---

# 5. **Command Injection**

- **Side:** Server-side
    

---

# 6. **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**

- **Risk:**  
    Inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, stealing cookies, session tokens, or defacing sites.
    
- **Proof:**  
    Google dorks targeting search boxes or comments, trying scripts like `<script>alert(1)</script>`.
    
- **Types:**
    
    - **Stored:** Malicious code saved on server, delivered to multiple users.
        
    - **Reflected:** Code reflected off a web server (URL or form).
        
    - **DOM-based:** Happens in client-side script, no server involvement.
        
- **Remediation:**
    
    - Escape and encode all outputs.
        
    - Use Content Security Policy (CSP).
        
    - Sanitize user inputs.
        
    - Use frameworks that auto-escape.
        
- **Side:** Client-side (in browser) but also server-side (where data is saved or reflected)
    

---

# 7. **LFI (Local File Inclusion)**

- **Risk:**  
    Attackers include files from the local server, leading to information disclosure or code execution.
    
- **Proof:**

    Lack of logs or alerts delays detection of breaches, enabling attacker persistence.
    
- **Proof:**  
    Absence of logs on suspicious activities.
    
- **Remediation:**
    
    - Implement centralized logging.
        
    - Alert on suspicious activities.
        
    - Regularly audit logs.
        
- **Side:** Server-side

# 13. **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)**

- **Risk:**  
    Server is tricked to make requests to internal resources or external malicious servers.
    
- **Proof:**  
    Inputs like URLs that the server fetches can be manipulated. Test with private IPs: `http://127.0.0.1/admin`.
    
- **Remediation:**
    
    - Validate and whitelist allowed URLs.
        
    - Disable unnecessary URL fetching.
        
    - Use network segmentation.
        
- **Side:** Server-side

### üí£ **Top Vulnerability Evaluation Factors**

1. ### **Severity (Impact)**
    
    > How bad is it if this vuln gets exploited?
    
    - Can it leak sensitive data?
        
    - Full system takeover?
        
    - Just crashes the app?  
        üß® High impact = high priority.
        
2. ### **Exploitability (Ease of Exploitation)**
    
    > How easy is it for an attacker to exploit it?
    
    - Script kiddie level? Or nation-state level?
        
    - Needs physical access? Or just a URL?  
        üß† Easier = more dangerous.
        
3. ### **Exposure (Attack Surface)**
    
    > Is the vuln exposed to the world or just internal?
    
    - Public web app = bigger risk
        
    - Backend API on private network = less risky  
        üåê Public exposure = hot zone.
        
4. ### **CVSS Score (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)**
    
    > Industry standard score from 0.0 to 10.0
    
    - 9.0‚Äì10.0 = Critical üö®
        
    - 7.0‚Äì8.9 = High
        
    - 4.0‚Äì6.9 = Medium
        
    - Below 4 = Low  
        üìä Objective, helps compare stuff.
        
5. ### **Authentication Required**
    
    > Can the vuln be exploited by anyone, or only after login?
    
    - No login = wild danger üò±
        
    - Requires admin access = less critical
        
6. ### **Privilege Required After Exploitation**
    
    > What kind of access does the exploit give?
    
    - Root? Admin? RCE?
        
    - Just user-level access?  
        üëë Higher privilege = bigger threat.
        
7. ### **Potential Business Impact**
    
    > What does this mean for the company?
    
    - Financial loss?
        
    - Reputation damage?
        
    - Legal risks (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)  
        üíº Business risk ‚â† always technical risk.
        
8. ### **Availability of Fixes**
    
    > Is there a patch or mitigation?
    
    - No fix = üö® danger zone
        
    - Easy patch = handled quick
        
9. ### **Known Exploits in the Wild**
    
    > Are attackers already using this?
    
    - If yes, it‚Äôs **zero chill** time
        
    - Public POC = move fast, patch faster
        
10. ### **Time to Exploit**
    
    > How long does it take to actually exploit?
    
    - Instant click?
        
    - Needs setup/config?  
        üïí Faster = scarier.
