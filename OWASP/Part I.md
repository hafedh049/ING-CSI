> - Add progressive delays after failed authentication attempts
> - Implement account lockout after a threshold of failed attempts
> - Use CAPTCHA or similar mechanisms for suspicious activity
> - Implement IP-based rate limiting for public endpoints
> - Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) with rate limiting capabilities
> - Monitor and alert on unusual patterns of requests

#### 5.5.2 Insecure SSL/TLS Configuration

> [!NOTE]
> **Description**: The application uses insecure SSL/TLS configurations, including support for outdated protocols, weak cipher suites, and improper certificate validation. This weakens the encryption and can make the application vulnerable to various attacks.
>
> **Risk**:
> - **Likelihood**: Low ‚Äì Exploiting SSL/TLS misconfigurations typically requires specialized knowledge and tools.
> - **Impact**: Medium ‚Äì Successful exploitation can lead to information disclosure, session hijacking, or man-in-the-middle attacks.
>
> **System**: `https://testphp.vulnweb.com/`
>
> **Tools Used**: SSLyze, Nmap
>
> **Evidence**:
> SSL/TLS configuration analysis revealed several issues.

> *Screenshot 17: SSL/TLS Configuration Analysis*
>
> **Remediation**:
> Implement secure SSL/TLS configurations:
> - Disable outdated protocols (SSLv3, TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1)
> - Remove support for weak cipher suites
> - Use strong certificates (2048+ bit RSA or ECC) from trusted CAs
> - Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
> - Enable OCSP Stapling for efficient certificate validation
> - Configure perfect forward secrecy
> - Regularly test SSL/TLS configuration with tools like SSL Labs

## Appendix B: Vulnerability Scoring

### CVSs Scoring Methodology

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a framework for communicating the characteristics and severity of software vulnerabilities. CVSS consists of three metric groups: Base, Temporal, and Environmental. The Base metrics produce a score ranging from 0 to 10, which can then be modified by scoring the Temporal and Environmental metrics.

> [!INFO]
> **Base Score Metrics:**
> - **Exploitability Metrics:** Attack Vector (AV), Attack Complexity (AC), Privileges Required (PR), User Interaction (UI)
> - **Impact Metrics:** Confidentiality Impact (C), Integrity Impact (I), Availability Impact (A)
> - **Scope:** Whether a vulnerability in one component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope
